Each subject performed the following activities which were measured and collected:
 WALKING
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 SITTING
 STANDING
 LAYING


The train-x and test-x contains the following variables collected across 3 axial raw signals.  Therefore, each variable collected has an X, Y, and Z datapoint for each subject for each activity.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
