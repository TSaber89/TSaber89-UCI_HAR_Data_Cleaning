Project Description:
=====================================
This project is designed to test the student's ability to collect and clean a dataset.  The dataset is located at the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The goal of the project is to prepare a final tidy dataset that could be used for later analysis.  The following criteria must be met:
1. The training and test sets are to be merged into a single table.
2. Only the mean and standard deviation are to pulled for each measurement.
3. Descriptive names must be applied to the activities.
4. Labels the data set with the appropriate variable names.

Dataset Description
====================================
The zipped file from the above URL contains the following files to be used for this project:
1. features_info.txt - Provides information about the variables used for the feature vector.
2. features.txt - Lists all of the different variables collected for the study.
3. activity_labels.txt - A description of the various activities used for the study.
4. x_train.txt - Contains the data for the subjects across all variables that were in the non-test group.
5. y_train.txt - Contains the labels for the training (non-test) group.
6. x_test.txt - Contains the data for the subjects across all variables that were in the test group.
7. y_test.txt - Contains the labels for the test group.

======================================
Requirements for Project
======================================
1. The test and train datasets are merged into one single dataset
2. Only those variables for the mean or standard deviation of a variable are to be presented in the final table.
3. The activity column must contain the actual name of the activity.
4. The column names are to be replaced with descriptive, meaningful names representative of the variable.
